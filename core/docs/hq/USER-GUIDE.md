# HQ User Guide

The AI operating system for your company. A shared context layer on top of Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex — syncs knowledge, skills, and capabilities across your team. Scales from solopreneur to enterprise.

### HQ CLI: Files (vault sharing)

These are CLI commands (not slash commands) — direct surface for HQ vault access control. Full reference: `.claude/skills/hq-files/SKILL.md`.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `hq files share <prefix>...` | **Browser flow** — opens a share-session page where you batch-pick recipients (members, groups, "Share with All") with per-recipient read/write. Add `--no-open` to print the URL only. |
| `hq files share <prefix> --with <email\|grp_*\|@all> --permission <read\|write>` | **Direct grant** — single recipient (or `@all` for company-wide) without leaving the terminal |
| `hq files unshare <prefix> --with <principal>` | Revoke a grant (idempotent — exits 0 if already absent) |
| `hq files acl <prefix>` | Show ACL entries, creator, and your effective permission |

Share-session URLs are encrypted single-use 15-minute capabilities — never paste them into commits, threads, or logs. See policy `core/policies/hq-share-session-urls-are-capabilities.md`.

### HQ CLI: Vault databases (`hq db`)

Structured storage for agent and app state — not a replacement for markdown knowledge. Full guide: `core/knowledge/public/hq-core/vault-databases.md`. CLI: `@indigoai-us/hq-cli` ≥ 5.62.0.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `hq db status --company {co}` | Create/open local SQLite at `~/.hq/db/{co}/vault.db` (WAL) |
| `hq db sql --company {co} -- 'SELECT …'` | Query the company local DB (read-only by default) |
| `hq db migrate --company {co} --hq-root {HQ}` | Apply reviewable SQL under `companies/{co}/db/migrations/` |
| `hq db provision --company {co}` | Remote DB on **HQ Team** plan only (secrets never printed) |

Use local for single-machine agent skills and implementer standards. Use Team remote for multi-machine shared data and deploy SecretBinding. Never commit `*.db` files into the vault tree.

### HQ CLI: Direct messages (`hq dm`)

Send a person-to-person notification to a teammate. They receive it in their HQ Sync menubar app. Full reference: `.claude/skills/dm/SKILL.md` (`/dm`).

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `hq dm <email\|prs_*> "<message>"` | Send a DM — recipient gets a macOS notification in HQ Sync |
| `hq dm <r> "<m>" --prompt "<context>"` | Attach agent context — recipient gets a one-click **Copy prompt** action to paste into their own agent |
| `hq dm <r> "<m>" --details "<text>"` (or `--details-file <path>`) | Longer text shown in the recipient's **Open details** window |
| `hq dm <r> "<m>" --at <iso>` / `--in <30s\|10m\|2h\|1d>` | Schedule delivery (store-and-forward — arrives even if you're offline at that time) |

Receiving is handled by the **HQ Sync menubar app** (it's receive-only — there's no send UI; sending is session/CLI only). You can only DM someone you share an active company with; DM your own email for a note-to-self or reminder. Never put secrets in a DM body/prompt/details — they're stored server-side.

### Company & Infrastructure
| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/newcompany` | Scaffold new company with full infrastructure |
| `/designate-team` | Mark a company directory as cloud-backed |
| `/sync-registry` | Regenerate a company's resource registry index |
| `/discover` | Pull a repo into HQ and synthesize structured knowledge |
| `/import-claude` | Scan the machine for Claude artifacts and import into HQ |
| `/setup` | Interactive setup wizard for HQ Starter Kit |
| `/update-hq` | Upgrade HQ from latest hq-core release |
| `/convert-codex` | Additive conversion so Codex has first-class AGENTS.md guidance |
| `/tutorial` | Interactive hands-on tutorial on HQ principles and workflow |
| `/harness-audit` | Score HQ setup quality across categories |
| `/cleanup` | Audit and clean HQ to enforce current policies |

### Misc
| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/personal-interview` | Deep interview to populate profile / voice |
| `/ascii-graphic` | Generate ASCII block-art banners for posts and OG images |

**Company Workers** (`companies/{co}/workers/`):

Each company can scaffold its own private workers via `/newworker`. They live under `companies/{co}/workers/` and stay isolated from other companies. Use `/run {worker-id} {skill}` to invoke them.

## Companies

Each company owns its settings, data, and knowledge.

```
companies/
├── _template/      # Skeleton copied when scaffolding a new company
├── manifest.yaml   # Company registry
└── {company}/      # Add one directory per company you manage (via /newcompany)
```

A scaffolded company contains:

```
companies/{co}/
├── data/           # Exports, reports, journal entries
├── hooks/          # Company-scoped hooks
├── knowledge/      # Company knowledge base (embedded git repo)
├── people/         # Contact / personnel records
├── policies/       # Company-scoped rules
├── projects/       # PRDs and project state
├── repos/          # Symlinks → repos/{public|private}/
├── settings/       # Credentials & config
├── skills/         # Company-scoped skills
├── workers/        # Company-scoped workers
└── workspace/      # Company-scoped scratch / drafts
```

## Projects

PRDs live at `companies/{co}/projects/{name}/prd.json` for company work, or `personal/projects/{name}/prd.json` for personal/HQ work, with `README.md` as the human-readable view.

```
/plan "Build dashboard"          # creates PRD
/run-project customer-cube      # execute via Ralph loop / Codex
```

## Meeting notes, signals & ontology

HQ captures these **natively, per company** — check HQ first, not your email or a third-party notetaker.

- **Meeting notes** — recordings/transcripts the HQ meeting bot ingests into `companies/{co}/sources/meetings/`. Read them with `/meeting-notes` (or `hq meetings list|notes --company {co}`).
- **Signals** — decisions, action items, wins, risks, open questions, and commitments extracted from your meetings, in `companies/{co}/signals/`. Read them with `/signals`.
- **Ontology** — situational context about a company (who/what is active, recent decisions) via the `ontology` skill.

**Turnkey setup (activation ladder):**

1. Make the company cloud-backed → `/designate-team {co}`.
2. Invite the HQ meeting bot to a call → notes ingest into `companies/{co}/sources/meetings/` automatically.
3. Signals are extracted from ingested notes into `companies/{co}/signals/`; ontology context follows.

**Your preference for "meeting notes":** defaults to HQ-native. To point a company at email instead, set `meeting_notes_source: email` in `companies/{co}/settings/knowledge/preferences.yaml` (global default lives in `personal/settings/knowledge-preferences.yaml`).

> Signals extraction and the ontology gardener run on HQ cloud and will require HQ Pro once billing ships. Billing isn't live yet — today these are provisioned per-company when you cloud-back it via `/designate-team`. Reference: `core/knowledge/public/hq-core/native-knowledge-stores.md`.

## Typical Session

1. `/startwork` — pick company/project/repo, gather context
2. Do work
3. `/checkpoint` — save progress
4. `/handoff` — prep for next session

## Knowledge Bases

**Public** (in `core/knowledge/public/`):
- `Ralph/` — coding methodology
- `agent-browser/` — browser automation patterns
- `ai-security-framework/` — security practices
- `dev-team/` — dev team patterns
- `getting-started/` — onboarding material
- `hq-core/` — thread schema, HQ patterns
- `loom/` — Loom agent patterns (reference)
- `projects/` — project templates
- `workers/` — worker framework reference

**Private** (in `core/knowledge/private/`):
- Empty by default — populated via packs (e.g. `@indigoai-us/hq-pack-*`) or sync.

**Company-level** (in `companies/{co}/knowledge/`):
- Each company has an embedded git repo populated through use.
