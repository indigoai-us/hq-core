# HQ Migration Guide

Newest release first. `## Release: TBD` collects promotions staged for the next
release; the release workflow stamps it with the version at tag time.

## Release: TBD

- **`/brainstorm` interviews properly again and stores research:** Step 3 is a
  decision-queue grilling — separate `AskUserQuestion` calls, one question at a
  time, covering every unresolved directional input (4-8 questions is normal;
  the prior "1 question max / skip if clear" behavior is removed). Step 4 now
  writes research notes to `{project_dir}/research/` (HQ landscape, market
  landscape, per-topic web notes) linked from brainstorm.md, and live web
  research is default-on for external-facing ideas. Pattern adapted from
  mattpocock/skills wayfinder. No action required for existing installations;
  the skill file is replaced on `/update-hq`.

## Release: v15.0.93-beta.1

- **Knowledge repositories must be real directories:** `/setup`, `/newcompany`,
  `/import-claude`, `/tutorial`, cleanup guidance, and the public README now use
  canonical real directories with optional embedded git. They no longer create or
  endorse repositories under `repos/` symlinked into `core/knowledge/`,
  `personal/knowledge/`, or `companies/{co}/knowledge/`. Existing installations
  with legacy knowledge symlinks should materialize the same content at the
  canonical path, preserve git there if needed, and verify `test -d PATH` plus
  `! test -L PATH` before the next cloud sync. `hq reindex` (hq CLI with the
  knowledge-migration pass) does this automatically: it scours the canonical
  knowledge locations, pulls each legacy repo, copies it inline with history
  preserved as an embedded repo, and removes the fully migrated legacy repo.

## Release: v15.0.91-beta.1

- promote 2026-08-12 (**Grok 4.6 workflow default**): the `/orchestrate` workflow runner
  (`core/scripts/workflow-runner.mjs`) now defaults its grok plan/exec tier models to
  `grok-4.6` (was `grok-4.5`), matching the newly released model. No action required — the
  defaults remain overridable via `HQ_WORKFLOW_GROK_PLAN_MODEL` / `HQ_WORKFLOW_GROK_EXEC_MODEL`,
  and reasoning effort is still inherited from the grok CLI config (`~/.grok/config.toml`),
  not set by the runner.

## Release: v15.0.88

- promote 2026-08-10 (**/deploy comments opt-in**): `/deploy` gains `--comments on|off`
  documenting turning the per-app comment widget on/off (`commentsEnabled`). The flag is
  orthogonal to the access mode and off by default — without it the deploy is byte-identical
  to a pre-feature deploy. A new Phase C step (`C.2.6`) PATCHes the per-app `commentsEnabled`
  flag after upload so the deploy pipeline injects the comment widget on the next deploy; a
  gated deploy's comment thread enforces the same access gate as the deploy itself.
