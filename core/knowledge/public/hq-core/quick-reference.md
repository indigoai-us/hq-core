**Personal overlay semantics.** `personal/` mirrors the shape of `core/` but is user-personal authoring space. The old reindex symlink mirror into `core/` was **retired** — `personal/{knowledge,policies,settings,workers}` are now read DIRECTLY from `personal/` by the code that consumes each (the policy trigger hook, the workers-registry generator, the session/knowledge readers), and reindex prunes any leftover mirror symlinks:

| Subdir | Runtime behavior |
|---|---|
| `personal/hooks/<event>/*.sh` | **Loaded as a separate ordered layer** — runs after `core/hooks/<event>/` and before `core/packages/*/hooks/<event>/` |
| `personal/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` | Surfaces as `/<skill>` — same flat command name as a core skill. Claude Code's `.claude/commands/<subdir>/<name>.md` surfacing puts the subdirectory in the command *description* (`(project:personal)`), not the command name. Collisions with a core skill of the same name are won by whichever ordering Claude Code resolves first; rename your personal skill to disambiguate. |
| `personal/knowledge/<entry>` | Read directly from `personal/knowledge/` (no `core/` mirror) — loads alongside core |
| `personal/policies/<entry>` | Read directly by the policy trigger hook (no `core/policies/` mirror) — loads as global; NOT a separate precedence layer |
| `personal/workers/<entry>` | Walked directly by the workers-registry generator (no `core/workers/` mirror) — surfaces as a worker |
| `personal/settings/<entry>` | Read directly from `personal/settings/` (no `core/settings/` mirror) |

Collision rule: with the mirror retired there is no link path to collide on. Both the personal and the core copy are read; a consumer that dedups by identity resolves same-id twins with personal first (e.g. the policy trigger hook scans `personal/policies/` ahead of `core/policies/`, so an operator's global rule wins over a same-id core copy).

## CLI: `hq files` (vault sharing)

Not slash commands — direct CLI surface for HQ vault access control. Skill: `.claude/skills/hq-files/SKILL.md`.

| Command | Use |
|---------|-----|
| `hq files share <prefix>...` | Browser flow — multi-recipient share-session page (no `--with` flag) |
| `hq files share <prefix> --no-open` | Browser flow but print URL instead of launching |
| `hq files share <prefix> --with <email\|grp_*\|@all> --permission <read\|write>` | Direct grant |
| `hq files unshare <prefix> --with <principal>` | Revoke (idempotent) |
| `hq files acl <prefix>` | Inspect ACL + your effective permission |

Share-session URLs are encrypted single-use 15-minute capabilities — never persist them in commits, threads, or logs. See `core/policies/hq-share-session-urls-are-capabilities.md`.

## CLI: `hq db` (vault databases)

Local SQLite per company (always) + optional remote Postgres-class on **HQ Team** ($500/mo). Guide: `core/knowledge/public/hq-core/vault-databases.md`. Requires `@indigoai-us/hq-cli` ≥ 5.62.0.

| Command | Use |
|---------|-----|
| `hq db status --company {co}` | Ensure local `~/.hq/db/{co}/vault.db` (WAL); report schema version |
| `hq db sql --company {co} -- 'SELECT …'` | Query local DB (read-only default; `--write` for mutations) |
| `hq db migrate --company {co} --hq-root {HQ}` | Apply `companies/{co}/db/migrations/*.sql` |
| `hq db provision --company {co}` | Remote binding — **Team plan only** (when control plane live) |

Migrations are vault **text**; binary `.db` files stay machine-local (never under `companies/`). Never print connection strings. Local and remote are not auto-replicated in v1.

## CLI: `hq dm` (direct messages)

Send a person-to-person notification to a teammate's HQ Desktop App. Skill: `.claude/skills/dm/SKILL.md` (`/dm`).

| Command | Use |
|---------|-----|
| `hq dm <email\|prs_*> "<message>"` | Plain DM — recipient gets an HQ Desktop App notification |
| `hq dm <r> "<m>" --prompt "<ctx>"` | Attach agent context — recipient gets a one-click "Copy prompt" action |
| `hq dm <r> "<m>" --details "<text>"` / `--details-file <path>` | Longer text shown in the recipient's "Open details" window |
| `hq dm <r> "<m>" --at <iso>` / `--in <30s\|10m\|2h\|1d>` | Schedule delivery (store-and-forward) |

Receive-only in the app — sending is session/CLI only. You can only DM someone you share an active company with; DM your own email for a note-to-self/reminder. Never put secrets in a DM (stored server-side).

## Command ↔ Skill Shapes

Every command exists as `.claude/commands/{name}.md` (the slash-command entry point) and most have a paired `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md` (the Skill-tool canonical logic). Two valid shapes:

**Consolidated (default for new commands)** — `.md` is a ~20-line delegator stub, `SKILL.md` holds the canonical logic. One source of truth, no drift. Converted pairs (Phase 3.1 audit): `search`, `audit-log`, `brainstorm`, `startwork`, `plan`, `handoff`, `learn`, `execute-task`.

**Thin-router split (only one)** — `run-project`. The `.md` is the canonical docs/flags/examples source (622 lines). The `SKILL.md` is a ~66-line bash wrapper that execs `core/scripts/run-project.sh`. They stay forked because one is human-facing documentation and the other is a dispatch shim — different jobs, neither redundant.

**Intentional exceptions (metadata stubs, no SKILL.md)** — `review`, `investigate`, `retro`, `document-release`, `review-plan`. These are frontmatter-only commands that dispatch prompts; no skill logic to split.

**Rule for new commands:** start with the consolidated shape — write the canonical logic in `SKILL.md`, leave `.md` as a stub copying `.claude/commands/startwork.md`'s shape (frontmatter → H1 → intro → `## Steps` → `## After`). Only fork if you have a genuine thin-router reason like `run-project`.

## Knowledge Bases

**Public** (`core/knowledge/public/`): Ralph, ai-security-framework, agent-browser, curious-minds, dev-team, hq-core, loom, projects, workers. Optional packs (install via `hq install @indigoai-us/hq-pack-*`) add: design-styles, design-quality, gemini-cli.

**Private** (`core/knowledge/private/`): linear

**Company-level** (`companies/{co}/knowledge/`): All 14 companies have embedded git repos.

## Policies

Standing operational rules per company. Location: `companies/{co}/policies/*.md`
Cross-cutting rules: `core/policies/*.md` (47 policies)
Spec: `core/knowledge/public/hq-core/policies-spec.md`. Template: `companies/_template/policies/example-policy.md`
